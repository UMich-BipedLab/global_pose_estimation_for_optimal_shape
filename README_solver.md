# Global Solver For 3D LiDAR Intrinsic Calibration 
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the methods to solve the intrinsic parameters for a 3D LiDAR. The proposed model is described in paper: [Global Unifying Intrinsic Calibration for Spinning and Solid-State LiDARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03321).

### Install the library
Run the `setup.m` script.
Note you should have installed *CVX* (available [here](http://cvxr.com/cvx/)) in the path:

- [Download CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/) for your platform
- Install CVX: Run `cvx_setup.m` from Matlab

### Run the examples
For a working example, see *example.m*.
